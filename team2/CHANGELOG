	* Added Highcharts JS graph with dynamic, occupation-specific median annual salary data to Salary Page.
	* The reason why Highcharts was chosen was because it reads directly from an HTML table which is actually coded on the HTML page (yet has its display hidden); we have not yet quite figured out how to send the templated Handlebars data on the HTML side to the Javascript side, so this may be something to explore in the future.
